This read file is for me to see detail what steps I need to complete this project.

FRONT END
We can start with the front end, The front end will conist of 4 outline blocks

The header- 
This is simple and just gives a title of the webpage it will span across
the webpage

The stack- 
 this will be a coulmn shape on the left side of the webpage. it will fall below
the header
    This will have to be a dynamic box that will change with more tickets that are inputed. So if there are 10 tickets the user will be able to scroll to the bottom. Here
they will have only 2 choices PER box of inputed data to DELETE or CHANGE(CREATE) My 
thoughts with this is if they click on DELTE that it will delete the post they clicked on 
and allow them to CREATE again with the same data they had before.

The Ticket box- 
the ticket box is a retangle box that will be under the header starting from the right of the stack to span across
    This box will have Input boxes that will have NAME,DATE,LOCATION,TICKET PROBLEM,PHONE and severity of the problem booleen

The Map box- This will be placed below the ticket box and start at the right of the stack and take up the rest of the website space.
    I will have to use a API to input the map in this space, I will need to figure out how to make this map interact with the ticket box. My plan is when the user clicks on a location that the LOCATION box auto fills out, I might grey the LOCATION box so the it will auto input and the user cannot fill this part out. I will be planning to use Texas but if I can make the whole USA I will do that
